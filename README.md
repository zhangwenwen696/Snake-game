# Snake-game
 There's a green snake on the screen, and you can control its movement up, down, left, and right using the arrow keys. The red squares are foodâ€”when the snake eats the food, it grows longer and your score increases. The game ends if the snake hits the wall or its own body. There are also start and restart buttons on the interface.
